    - This class is not designed to be accessed from multiple threads; it was created without
      locking for fast and efficient use when used from a single thread.  For methods that would be
      unsafe to use in another thread, any use of such methods in threads other than the thread where the constructor was called will cause a \c ZSOCKET-THREAD-ERROR to be thrown.
